# chaplin-express
Loading and displaying a webpage with express

This readme file shall help incase you want to get this project working on your own PC. Here are some instructions:
The project requires node.js and npm to run. I have installed the required npm packages with the --save tag.
The --save tag means that my code handily remembers all the packages that it requires!
All you have to do is enter the main project folder in commandline and type "npm install". This should install the packages automatically.
Once installed, type "node server.js" and it should tell you that Charlie Chaplin is running in port 3000.
Now open your web browser and set the address to http://localhost:3000/. The page should show now.

This project was made following the instructions here:

I'd like to thank aurel kurtula for this learning experience that I can hopefully later apply to Infinity Skate Shop!
